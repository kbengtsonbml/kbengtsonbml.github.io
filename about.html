    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the "About Us" page. Here you can find a paragraph about each of our wonderful coding girls.
      We wrote these about ourselves with little boundaries, so the content is different for everyone.
      We even chose our own fonts!
      The only thing that all of our entries have in common is that we all included our favorite book and the pages we did for the site.
    </p>

        Hi, my name is Charlotte. Some of my hobbies are coding and solving the Rubik's Cube.
        I am the creater this page and the home page. I was also in Girls Who Code last
        year. I'm not the best at making decisions, so I think my favorite book is <b><i><u>Undecided???</u></i></b>
        Maybe I need to use this site to help myself.

        <b>Γεια σου</b>, my name is Emily. I'm a 6th grader at Clark Lane Middle School. My hobbies are coding, reading,
        going to every club I can find, and trying to learn 25 languages including the coding languages.
        I don't have a favorite book, but one of my favorite authors is Jessica Day George. I created the Jokes and Comics
        page and the Book Lists page. I was in the girls who code last year, like I am this year. <br>
        P.S. This picture is not my favorite book, just one of the books I read by Jessica Day George

        My name is Kate, and I am the grown-up in the group!  I've watched as these amazing gals have coded this website from a blank page!
      I offered advice about coding and provided snacks, but that's about it.  My favorite book is the Dark Tower Series by
      Stephen King.

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Kayla. I'm considered a bit unique, since I read more then 500 pages a day. I wanted to share
        about some of my favorite authors, so I created a few quizzes. I also love riding horses, swimming, and hanging
        out with my friends. This is my second time doing Girls Who Code, and I've had a great time. I love so many books,
        it's hard to choose a favorite. I guess I could go with Throne of Glass, if I had to choose. It's a great series, by
        Sarah J. Maas. If anybody out there's read it, be sure to give it a book talk on our chat page.

      <p> Hi i'm Sarina, and I love ANYTHING related to sugar. My favorite book series is Harry Potter, and I almost read all 7 books twice.<br>
        I also enjoy doing crafts when I don't have anything to do. My favorite instrument is the violin obviously because that is the only instrument I play. <br>
        If you gave me a bowl of frosting and a cake without frosting I'd probably pick the frosting :}
